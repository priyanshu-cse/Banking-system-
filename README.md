This C++ Bank Management System allows users to create, modify, deposit, withdraw, and delete accounts, all while utilizing file handling for data persistence. The system supports operations on account details, balance checks, and transaction management through a menu-driven interface. Ideal for learning C++ OOP and file handling.

The account.dat file in this code is used to store the account information of customers in binary format. It serves as a persistent data storage for the bank management system, allowing the program to save and retrieve account details such as account number, account holder's name, account type, and balance.
